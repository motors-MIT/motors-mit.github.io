## The Basics

[Introduction to Motors, and their Applications](/intro)
- Types of Motors, and Motor Selection
- List of Good Pre-Requisite Resources

## Brushed DC Motors Selection + Control

- Brushed Motor Physics Equation Derived, Torque Speed Curve, Etc 
- Start w/ a simple DC motor that can do current control (NO GATE DRIVE CHIP, just use an H-bridge controller and current sensor, modular)
- Go into types of control, PWM, speed control, position control, then current control
- Design of Brushed Motor Inverters (fet selection, current sensing, PWM clock speeds)
- Regenerative Braking in Brushed Systems (without a gate drive chip)
- Introduction to Gate Drive Chips + Why you might want to Use them

## Brushless DC Motors Selection + Control

- Brushless DC Motors overview, three-phase 
- Simple forms of brushless motor control
- Field-Oriented Control + Theory, torque control of three-phase motors (using a small BLDC and something like an O-Drive)
- SVM (space-vector modulation)
- Calibration routines, current sensing, encoders and state estimation for commutation 
- Designing an Inverter for three-phase brushless motor control w/ a Gate Drive chip 
- Designing an Inverter for three-phase brushless motor control with Discrete Gate Drivers + Current Sensing (circuitden.com/blog/11)
- Regenerative Braking in Brushless Systems 

## Higher Level Forms of Control! 

- Impedance Control! (fun applications)
- Field Weakening Control for BLDC motors

## Power Generation

## Motor Design + Testing

- Poles Slots
- Brush wear for brushed systems
- Bearing selection + design
- Ansys Motor CAD 
- Dyno systems
