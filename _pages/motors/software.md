## Note

The following list contains software that can be used for motor design and control, and electronics design. We will start by listing the software we use, but we will also list many alternatives. The software described ranges in both price, features, and acessiblity. We apolgoize that some of the software we use is not free or open-source due to the nature of our requirements as a lab. However, **everything we will teach you is applicable to all software on this list,** and with a few extra tutorials, you should be able to apply the knowledge. **Remember, engineering is about the application of knowledge. If robust understanding is there, the software does not matter.**

#### List of Software for Learning

The following is a list of software we will actively use in tutorials around motors and motor control. You will need this software to complete some of the exercises in this notebook. 

#### List of Preferred Software

The following is a list of software we use in our own research, some of the software replaces the 'Learning' software, and much of it is referenced in the tutorials. 

##### CAD/ECAD/Modeling

[Solidworks]() (we will export all files as AP242 STEP Format)

[Altium Designer]()

##### Simulation

[Ansys MotorCAD]()

[Matlab Simulink]()

##### Embedded Systems

[STMCube IDE]()

[STMCube Programmer]()

#### Alternative (but STILL GOOD) Software

##### CAD/ECAD/Modeling

[Autodesk Fusion 360]()

[Autodesk Eagle]()

##### Simulation

[MotorAnalysis]()

[LTspice]()
